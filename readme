# You should prepare for MOD, ev.reloc, Qp_model.dat, and DWS files
  Put those files into "Input" folder
  Those files' formats are the same as FILES outputed from TomoDD program

# Main_Plotting_Qimage.m
  it is used to plot 2D Q image and event projection, and can be used to clip map by using DWS values

# setting_plot.m 
  it is used to define the attributes of figure for improving plotting quality

# CrossXY_plane.m
  it is uesed to plotting Q image along the Z direction
  And ouput x,y,z data for GMT plotting.

# CrossXZ_plane.m
  it is used to plotting Q image along Y direction; and we interpolate the Q value in log domain
  And output x,y,z data for GMT plotting

# CrossYZ_plane.m
  it is used to plotting Q image along X direction; and we interpolate the Q value in log domain
  And output x,y,z data for GMT plotting
